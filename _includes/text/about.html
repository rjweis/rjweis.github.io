    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        I am from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and I moved to Reykjavík in June, 2020 to live with my wife, Unnur Rún. I’ve recently earned my Master’s of Science in Analytics, and I’m actively searching for data science, data analyst, and consulting roles in Reykjavík. I’m also interested in remote positions, internships, and pro bono work. Read more about my skills and work experience <a href="/cv.html">here</a>, and read on below to learn about my life story.

    <h3>Master of Science in Analytics</h3>

    <p>
        In May, 2020, I earned my Master’s of Science in Analytics (MSA) from the <a href="https://analytics.ncsu.edu/?page_id=123">Institute of Advanced Analytics</a> at North Carolina State University, located in Raleigh, North Carolina. During the intensive, 10-month masters program, I spent nearly 60 hours a week immersed in learning and applying analytics with roughly 120 talented classmates. The program is highly selective, with acceptance rates hovering around 15% in recent years. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My favorite part of the MSA program was the practicum. Along with four of my classmates, we had the opportunity to spend eight months working on an analytics project for <a href="https://www.asurion.com/">Asurion</a>, a cell phone insurance and warranty company. I can’t disclose many details due to our nondisclosure agreement, but essentially our team used natural language processing and machine learning techniques to deliver insights about the business’s call routing system. Our final deliverable consisted of a presentation to senior members of Asurion’s analytics team, as well as a demo of a dashboard our team made with the Dash module in Python.

    <p>
        (I gave an informal workshop to my practicum team to help us get started with Dash. Check it out <a href="https://github.com/rjweis/Dash-Workshop">here</a>.)

    <p>
        My practicum experience was extremely valuable, because it allowed me to apply what I was learning in the classroom to a real-world business problem. Furthermore, I gained experience with communicating with stakeholders to define the scope of the project. It was also a great exposure to version control with Git.

    <h3>Teaching, Language, and Culture: Teaching English in France</h3>

    <p>
        The idea of pursuing a career in teaching had always been in the back of my mind since high school. I felt inspired to think that I could have an impact on a student’s life --  just as my teachers and mentors had impacted mine. Still, I was unsure whether a career in teaching was right for me. So, the natural next step was to give it a shot. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My curiosity about teaching, in part, is what brought me to France. I fell in love with the language when I was sixteen and took classes all throughout college. I knew the best way to improve my speaking skills would be to move and live in France. I did some research and discovered a program called <a href="https://frenchhighereducation.org/teaching-assistant-program">TAPIF</a> that allows Americans to teach English in French public schools for one school year. Coupled with my interest in teaching, this was a perfect fit for me.
    </p>
    <p>
        I applied and was accepted as an assistant de langue in a small city called Clermont-Ferrand, located in the south of France. I moved there in September, 2018, shortly after I had graduated from college. It was a fantastic gap year. I made friends with some of my colleagues and a few other American teaching assistants. My French improved a lot, and I practiced my public speaking skills in front of my classes on a daily basis. I even advertised myself as a private tutor and secured myself a handful of clients.

    <h3>Music, Economics, and Public Policy at UNC-Chapel Hill</h3>

    <p>
        In August, 2014, my undergraduate career started at UNC-Chapel Hill as a double major in Music and Global Studies. As a classical percussionist, I had decided to pursue music because I had earned a full-tuition scholarship as a <a href="https://kenanmusicscholars.unc.edu/">Kenan Music Scholar</a>. Global Studies, on the other hand, simply seemed to be a good fit because of my interest in other cultures. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Sadly, studying music at such a rigorous level began to wear away my love of music after just two semesters. Music became something I <em>had</em> to do, rather than something I looked forward to.
    </p>
    <p>
        After some reflection and research, I switched my majors to Economics and Public Policy. I chose these fields because I had become aware that millions of Americans work full-time jobs but still live under the federal poverty line. I thought this was unfair, and believed that I could somehow make some sort of difference through research in Economics and Public Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Towards the end of my degree, I had realized two things. First, maybe I had been a bit naïve. Meaningful, systemic change takes a <em>very</em> long time in the U.S. Did I have the patience to dedicate my career towards a goal and end up with a little to no results? I didn’t think so at the time. Ultimately, I decided that having a career that allowed me to support those working towards helping those in need could still be satisfying -- even if I didn’t think I would be changing the world solely from my day job. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, through my courses in data analysis and regression, I discovered that I really enjoy statistics and asking questions. Statistics add objective context to discussions and can help make decisions. I think that’s pretty cool!

    <h3>Testimonials</h3>
    <p>During my master's, I worked on with many classmates on a number of different teams. Here is what some of my teammates had to (anonymously) say about me.</p>
